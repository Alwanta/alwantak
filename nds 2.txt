The inception of the groundbreaking Nodal Displacement Sequencing (NDS) approach can be attributed
to the visionary physicist, Iraj Jafarian, also known as Fuzzy Logic. With a specialization in quantum theory,
Dr. Jafarian's unique perspective and expertise allowed him to develop a fresh approach to market
analysis, which has disrupted traditional market models. NDS offers a new method of predicting market
behavior that is consistent, systematic, and reliable. Dr Jafarian's work in this field has transformed the
way we think about financial markets and has opened up new avenues for understanding and predicting
market dynamics.

The purpose of this research project is to introduce a revolutionary explanatory framework for
comprehending market behavior. Dubbed Nodal Displacement Sequencing (NDS), this pioneering
approach strives to provide a dependable and systematic mechanism for forecasting futures market
activity. By utilizing a matrix structure that encompasses all zero-sum instruments, including Forex,
Futures, and commodities, this innovative concept can drastically minimize the risk envelope. In essence,
NDS will bring about a paradigm shift similar to that of quantum physics, which superseded
classical/Newtonian physics by discarding technical indicators and several prevailing quantitative models.
Crafting a financial mathematical or geometrical model demands a set of preconceived notions about the
underlying assets. Regrettably, many of these assumptions prove to be flawed, relying on arbitrary
variables to demarcate risk boundaries. For instance, a basic stochastic model presupposes that 14 units
of time delineate the pinnacle of the volatility cycle, sans any rationalization.

The number 14 appears to be a whimsical value imposed upon the model, devoid of mathematical or
statistical justification. Nonetheless, numerous self-styled technical analysts employ this imprecise
assumption with reckless abandon. Alas, such ill-conceived suppositions are also evident in the current
quant models. Nodal Displacement Sequencing is a cutting-edge geometric model that deviates from
conventional financial literature to anticipate market behavior. Rather than relying on existing literature or
unjustifiable variables, it utilizes a new understanding of cyclic nodes formed in market profiles as a result
of conscious participants inundating the order books to follow trends or capitalize on prevailing
momentum. In this model, historical nodes (established flooded reversal points) are used to predict the
next cycle formation using fractal and symmetry concepts, expressed in a mathematical format, making it
an algorithmic model. Essentially, instead of imposing unjustifiable variables such as X units of time to
measure volatility and market direction, the model starts with the established price level to predict the
next sequence, employing NDS criteria grounded in price symmetry and fractal engineering. Nodal
Displacement offers institutional traders an accurate and systematic roadmap to assess position risk,
along with a clear price target and market direction.

The Nodal Displacement Sequencing (NDS) is recognized as a geometric model that elucidates the
behavior of the market or the price action. It aims to provide a comprehensive explanation of how the
market functions and how prices fluctuate using specific geometric principles. The model seeks to provide
a clear and systematic approach to understanding market movements and price behavior through its
geometric framework. To be able to achieve the above one would need a new set of definitions as follows.


Nodes play a significant role in mathematical finance, although
their definition may vary depending on the context. In the
context of Nodal Displacement Sequencing (NDS), a node
refers to a specific point in time where momentum exhausts
and the market changes direction, forming a Zig Zag pattern.
Nodes have a matrix structure with high, low, close, and open
forming a 1 by 4 matrix. These levels can be identified every
day using various mathematical/quantitative equations. Nodes
are a crucial element of the market geometry model in NDS as
they provide a way to model and analyze the complex and
dynamic movements of prices and contracts over time. In
summary, Nodes serve as a fundamental component of NDS's
approach to predicting market behavior and assessing risk.

The market cycle refers to the existence of a certain pattern of fluctuations in the financial markets over X
period of time from a few seconds to a month or even years. It is characterized by periods of expansion,
peak, contraction, and trough. These cycles are the representation of the fear and greed of the market
participants resulting in a zero-sum market structure where the gains of one trader come at the expense
of another. These cycles have a certain deterministic geometry but do not adhere to a fixed or constant
pattern. This is because, apart from price, there are two other variables that come into play, time and
volume. Consequently, the market comprises three fundamental dimensions: price, time and volume.
Every trading session presents a unique set of cycles due to the fluidity of the order flow in the market. To
attain proficiency in identifying these cycles in Discretionary Trading, one must undergo rigorous mental
training and acclimate their eyes to these recurring patterns. However, fret not, as with time, this skill will
be deeply ingrained in your subconscious, and you will be able to decipher these patterns with ease.
Nodal displacement uses cycles and fractals to identify the top and bottom of these cycles.

The structure of a positive hook is shown here. In an ideal
hook pattern, we have three peaks and three valleys. In type
A positive hook we have 3 peaks followed by three valleys to
close the cycle. Notice how point 3 closes above point T
which is roughly around 86.4% of the length of the upward
move. The accompanying schematic shows the pattern of a
positive hook of type A at the end of the downtrend. Here
you can expect the price to go above the node 3.

A trading pattern known as the Flag holds significance as it signals the end of a trend. The Flag pattern is
often described as a sequence of events that begins with a rally, followed by the entry of sellers or SMI,
and ultimately, the emergence of a low volume upward spike from point Z to point F. However, the price
cannot sustain its upward trajectory at point F, and it will inevitably start to decline towards point T, thus
marking the end of the cycle. The occurrence of a Flag is a pivotal point in the trend. As such, the Flag
pattern is often closely watched by traders and investors, as it can provide valuable insights into market
trends and potential opportunities for reversal. In other words, The process starts with the formation of a
rally, and subsequently, sellers come into the market. Eventually, there is an upward low volume spike,
between point Z and point F. The price at point F cannot maintain its upward trend and begins to decline,
leading to point T, which completes the cycle.

The concept of futures market symmetry is an essential aspect of Nodal Displacement Sequencing (NDS)
analysis. It involves examining the length of a move in a particular direction and how far it will stretch to
reach a specific node. The mathematics of futures market symmetry is a complex and continuously
evolving field, with various techniques and models being used to analyze price action behavior. Traders
and investors use these techniques to gain insights into potential market movements, identify price
targets, and inform their trading decisions. Despite its complexity, futures market symmetry remains a
critical component of market analysis, helping to inform and shape our understanding of financial
markets.

The concept of a fractal futures market in mathematical finance involves using the principles of fractal
geometry to model and analyze financial markets. A fractal is a mathematical pattern that repeats itself at
different scales and time frames.

This article endeavors to introduce the formidable strategy of Nodal Displacement Sequencing or NDS,
which is based on five fundamental pillars. The foremost pillar, Fractal Analysis, occupies the apex of this
pyramid and provides a bird's eye view of the market, where higher time frames exert influence on lower
time frames, and the lower ones collaborate to construct higher time frames. Cycle Analysis forms the
second pillar, and it scrutinizes all types of cycles while examining their constituents. However, since Cycle
Analysis is a prerequisite for Fractal Analysis, we will initially delve into Cycle Analysis to acquaint
ourselves with its elements before proceeding to the first pillar, Fractal Analysis.

The third pillar, aptly named Symmetry,
is a vital component of the NDS which is
defined as a geometric transformation
and a spatial relationship of the extent
by which buyers or sellers are prepared
to pay for a certain contract, Symmetry
is ubiquitous across various time frames
from 1 second to yearly. The fourth
pillar, Sequencing, stands as the central
and most crucial element. The other
pillars are merely tools that support the
core of the Sequencing pillar.

This central pillar involves the sequential execution of nodes in a specific order, following the principle of a
certain geometry denoted by nodal numbering for example a certain node might have a certain level which
also carries a number associated with the node and the sequencing will move the market from one node to
the subsequent node. The sequencing is always done in a systematic and ordered manner. The Sequencing
pillar holds great importance in the market, as it is often observed in the natural cycle of seasons. Spring,
summer, autumn, and winter, for example, always follow a predetermined order without fail, maintaining a
definitive and unchanging sequence. We will delve deeper into this topic later in, exploring the intricacies of
this fundamental pillar and its significance in the market. The fifth pillar, Zero-Sum Game, is a mathematical
model of cycles opening and closing without failure in a situation in which one participant's gain or loss is
exactly equal to the losses (or gains) of the other participant(s). Below we will fully explain these five pillars
and then combine them.

It is understood that all zero-sum markets follow a cyclical pattern. Although these cycles are repeatable,
they are not easily distinguishable due to the fluctuation in daily trading volume. As the volume is
variable, the shape of the cycles also varies, but they all share a certain defining character. The present
chapter delves into the anatomy of a typical cycle, exploring its key features and characteristics. On the
next page, the schematic shows the overview of a positive cycle consisting of two Hook patterns, two
Rally patterns, and a Flag pattern. After the flag pattern, there is a downward drop, and the cycle closes at
the T point. So, in general, you can say that a cycle starts at point R and goes through two hooks, two
rallies, and a flag to point F and then drops to close the cycle at point T.

As you can see in the cycle anatomy, at the end of Rally, there is a drop called a Sellers Move In or SMI.
This term means that the sellers have moved in after which, the price rises a sharp exponential upward
move, but with a low volume (Low Volume Spike). This spike is the essential part of the reversal process
and the final upward node formation. A full cycle can be divided into the following subdivisions as follows
Hook1, Hook2, Rally, sellers moving in or SMI, Low volume spike or flag. We have already outlined the
structure of a hook of various forms so we move on to explain the structure of a rally. After the formation
of 2 consecutive hooks rally starts. The structure of a rally is seen on the next page.

In the realm of trading strategies, a prudent approach dictates that, prior to initiating any trade, one must
be well-informed of the prevailing direction of the higher time frame market. Due to its dominating
influence on the lower time frames, a firm grasp of the longer time frame forces is of paramount
importance. It is only by doing so that the odds of emerging victorious can be favorably shifted in one's
favor. Achieving accurate market direction is contingent upon a solid comprehension of fractals and their
intrinsic properties. Indeed, fractals are linked to the recurrence of self-similar patterns in nature, with
varying appearances resulting from fluctuations in daily trading volumes. Nonetheless, the systematic
designation of nodes within these discernible patterns remains strikingly similar across all timeframes,
from seconds to years resulting in a cycle With a certain anatomy. In fractal analysis, smaller patterns join
together to create bigger patterns. So, by this definition, we can say that any small pattern can later
develop into a bigger structure as seen below.

As seen above there are smaller cycles within larger cycles. In other words, a daily cycle has many many
cycles within it which open and close in turn to eventually all cycles close one after the other. The higher
time frame forces the lower time frame to open and close in a certain way The schematic presented
above showcases the Daily cycle comprising three smaller H1 cycles. The R point marks the
commencement of both the Daily cycle and the small H1 cycle, with the first H1 cycle concluding shortly
thereafter at 86.4% of its total length. The subsequent H1 cycle begins immediately and ends at 86.4% of
itself, while the large Daily cycle remains open. After the closure of both small H1 cycles, the large H1
cycle starts and ascends to point F. Finally, at point T, both the large H1 cycle and the Daily cycle come to
an end. This phenomenon represents a fractal perspective of the market, where H1 cycles initiate and
culminate consecutively, eventually closing their parent Daily cycle. With persistent practice and an
understanding of large and small cycles, one's mind becomes accustomed to this perspective with ease.
Notably, the fractal form of cycles observed earlier, in the shape of a half-circle, is, in fact, a cycle in itself.

Symmetry is considered a fundamental principle
of the NDS strategy that is applied in the market.
The concept of price symmetry revolves around
the notion that all rallies/pullbacks in the market
follow a specific length, where they extend to a
certain length to hit their target. This structure is
clearly visible in the following diagram.

The analysis of market structures through the use of the (NDS) can be described as the examination
of a market cycle or fractal and the subsequent sequential movement of price from one node to
another. These nodes, when executed, give rise to price action and serve as the fundamental driving
forces behind market movements. A complete cycle is composed of five primary patterns, consisting
of two hooks, two rallies, and a flag as introduced earlier. In the following pages, readers will gain
insight into using the five pillars mentioned in the previous chapters.

It is widely acknowledged that adherence to a set of rules is essential for achieving success. This
sentiment is particularly true when it comes to trading in the futures market. By building on the
definitions and concepts previously outlined, we can now delve into the specific rules that govern this
complex arena. These rules are objective and straightforward, emphasizing the importance of
following a well-defined set of guidelines in order to achieve success in the futures market.
Rule 1
We get the market direction from a higher timeframe and entry from a lower timeframe and not the
other way around. For day trading, 10 Minutes timeframe for market direction and 1 Minute
timeframe for entry is a perfect scenario. To further fine-tune the entry one can investigate the 30
Seconds timeframe.

Rule 2
Market direction is defined by 2 open nodes as
seen here, in this schematic since we have had 2
lots of open N1 and N2, the market direction is
up after the formation of the 1,2,3 as seen. This
is also true for the market downtrend

Rule 3
Lower time frames have priority in closing the cycles but they DON'T CHANGE longer time frame
market direction.
Rule 4
The end of any trend must display 3 lower lows (end of a downtrend) and 3 higher highs (end of a
uptrend). Reversal starts with Hook Hook Rally to close the next cycle.
Rule 5
There is no rule 5. However one needs to familiarize himself with these geometrical patterns to be
able to fully take advantage of the power of NDS.
Stop-Loss and Target
All trades must have a meaningful Stop-Loss. The Stop-Loss in NDS is a few points below the last
formation of 123.
The target is above the LAST N1 N2.

This is a proprietary subject but I will give an indication of how the geometry of the market can be
translated into the mathematics of price action suitable for algorithmic trending. There is a multitude
of ways to model NDS. One such approach is through the use of candlesticks, which can be used to
model patterns such as the 123 pattern or flag at the end of any trend. By examining how 10-minute
candles are formed within a given period of time, traders can identify potential long positions based
on three lower lows occurring within X period. This strategy, while simple, only takes into account the
immediate buying or selling pressure ignoring the fractal nature of the market and is best suited for
short-term scalping scenarios. Another approach to modelling NDS is through pattern recognition,
which can now be accomplished with the aid of artificial intelligence using a knowledge base of chart
patterns. By matching a given scenario to a database of known reversal patterns, traders can make
more informed decisions about when to enter or exit positions.

Finally, the preferred method of modelling NDS is through quantitative and mathematical analysis. As explained
before every reversal point forms a point called a node. These nodes are a matrix representing the price action
{open, close, high, low}. In NDS we only use high and low to mark the nodes so there will be a 1 by 2 matrix
instead of 1 by 4 There will also be the variable of time within which the market moves from one node to
another but that will not be discussed here as it is part of the proprietary model. The mathematics of NDS is to
execute the sequential order of these nodes irrespective of the occurrence of any news or events surrounding
the instrument. The sequence of NODES that reflects the price movements in financial markets is often seen as a
fundamental aspect of trading. These sequences, once initiated, cannot be altered by any news or events that
may occur. Instead, such events act as catalysts that accelerate the movement of prices from node to node. This
means that even major events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in a massive slowdown of the
global economy, could not stop the overall uptrend of the market. The mathematics of NDS, as developed by the
author, is a complex system that requires expertise in AI to fully fine-tune. The model employs a series of
polynomial functions to accurately model patterns such as flags, hooks, and the 123s. These functions produce
an estimate of the price target, but traders can use a transform function to feedback on any errors in the
previous nodes using AI. This allows for a more precise prediction of price movements both for time and price
